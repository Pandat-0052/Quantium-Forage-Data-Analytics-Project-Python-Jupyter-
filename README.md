## Overview

This project is part of the Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program on Forage. The aim is to analyze purchasing trends and behaviors, specifically focusing on customer segments and their chip purchasing behavior. The project consists of two main tasks:

1. **Task 1: Customer Analytics**
2. **Task 2: Store Trial Performance Evaluation**

## Task 1: Customer Analytics

### Objective
To understand current purchasing trends and behaviors, focusing on customer segments and their chip purchasing habits. The goal is to form a strategic recommendation for the Category Manager, Julia.

### Steps
1. **High-Level Data Checks:**
    - Create and interpret high-level summaries of the data.
    - Identify and remove outliers if applicable.
    - Check and correct data formats if necessary.

2. **Feature Derivation:**
    - Extract features such as pack size and brand name from the data.

3. **Metrics Definition:**
    - Define metrics of interest to draw insights on chip purchasing behavior by different customer segments.

### Data Files
- **CSV Data Files:** Contain transaction data with customer attributes such as LIFESTAGE and PREMIUM_CUSTOMER.

### Analysis
- Perform high-level summaries and check for data anomalies.
- Derive features and define metrics to analyze customer spending on chips.
- Use insights to provide a strategic recommendation to Julia.

## Task 2: Store Trial Performance Evaluation

### Objective
Evaluate the performance of a store trial conducted in stores 77, 86, and 88. Compare the performance with control stores to assess the impact of the trial.

### Steps
1. **Monthly Sales Experience:**
    - Calculate total sales revenue.
    - Determine the total number of customers.
    - Compute the average number of transactions per customer.

2. **Control Store Comparison:**
    - Select control stores using a metric such as Pearson correlations or magnitude distance.
    - Compare trial and control pairs during the trial period.
    - Test if total sales are significantly different during the trial period and identify drivers of change.

### Data Files
- **QVI_data Dataset:** Used for the analysis and comparison.

### Analysis
- Calculate and compare monthly sales experience metrics for trial and control stores.
- Use statistical methods to evaluate the impact of the trial.

### Skills Demonstrated
- Data analysis and visualization
- Feature engineering and derivation
- Customer segmentation and profiling
- Data-driven commercial insights and recommendations
- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
